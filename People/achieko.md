I'm a young aspiring I.T developer student at ITALANTA Academy Kakuma.
So far, I'm Currently venturing into software development under an extensive training of 30 weeks during.

At the end of training duration, I intend to be competent in the following programming languages ;
   
   1. **CSS** 
   2.  **HTML**
   3.  **Javascript** 
   4.  **SQL** 


I also intend to develop some latest apps that would add a long lasting impacts in the society. This is because is severe shortage  of I.T resources in the society.
In addition to that, there are many unemployed youth.

It is my desire to set up a cyber Center for the training those who are enthusiastic about I.t but they don't have opportunities.

These are the APPs that I'm going to develop:
  
  * E-Library
  * Tech Site
